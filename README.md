I've included every weapon that I am aware of or can find at the time of this release. (Game Build 2699)

I did NOT include the muzzle brakes, grips or the different color schemes for the weapons. Maybe next time.

As always feel free to modify to how you want. 



Issues that I am aware of and don't intend to fix right away.

1. For the special rounds and shells, once you run out all you have to do is open your inventory and use them again. It will give you the maximum ammount. 
2. You only need to buy 1 of each item to use. eg.. You buy 1 suppressor and you can use it on the pistols, rifles, shotguns, etc.
